# Git Log & Git Reset

`git` is a powerful and complex CLI that manages versions of your code. This lesson explores using the `git log` and `git reset`.

## The Manual

It is helpful to utilize [`git` documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) often as you grow as a developer. Sometimes it is even easier to launch `git` documentation in your shell session. Let's do this right now for `git log` and `git reset`, using the `--help` option. You can pass the `--help` option to any `git` command for more information.

```
git log --help
```

```
git reset --help
```

Take a few minutes to read about ways to use these commands.
